##  3 Introduction to myself
    I go by Jay or J. I am not the best with intros. I will I could describe who I am. I am so many things...I
    will not define myself.
    I have completely given up on love after my ex left. I’m realizing it’s OK for me to be more than just a
    daddy. I enjoy just being home a lot due to haze. But I also love going out for fun. I like to be outdoorsy. I
    also like to be indoorsy.
    Find out what you’d die for. Then live for it.
    I sleep with my door open in case i need to run away from the monster in my room. I have a hard
    time accepting compliments, but I am confident in my personality. I’m pretty open with my life story and
    non-judgmental.
    I was raised as southern not-so-bell, lakeside, cliff jumping, riding in the truck bed, on the back of my Dad’s
    motorcycle, fishing, dancing in my cowboy boots. The sky was lit by lightening bugs, the table illuminated with
    flickering Mason jars. In Seattle now. I’ve been amazed by the northern lights, a milky way it seemed I could
    touch, the most beautiful places! Those are the memories that make me happy. Please God send me a woman
    that doesn’t snore. no children, dont smoke, monogamous.
    I’ m not actively pursuing a relationship but if someone just happens to come my way that can make me
    laugh, is humble and healthy (mentally) wouldn’ t be opposed to a date. A well kept woman is a plus.
    I’m a free spirited gal who’s just full of life! I want to enjoy every moment of it without regrets.
    I am going through a divorce and need someone to talk to or be friends with. I’ m a busy man with a busy
    work schedule and had to be with my kids all the time cause they are the only ones have.
    Changing the world one day at a time by just being.
    I’m pragmatic1
    , Agnostic2
    ;atheistic [­eTi"IstIk] adj, outgoing, slightly introverted3
    , and punny4 all rolled up
    into one lady! I hope to find someone who can pun with the best but also talk about random facts and topics
    like how freaking far away all the planets in our solar system are from each other. Also... do you know the
    strongest days of the week? I love hiking, museums, dancing, random shenanigans5
    , and finding new interesting
    cuisine6.
    I am well me, you can’t really describe personality in words only in actions. We all have our stories and
    our faults that we have grown from learned from and built who we have become and who we are meant to be.
    I’m not the person I was 5 years ago and 5 years from now I won’t be who I am today. Embrace every second
    of life and enjoy every second of it, the good bad, and ugly.
    Life sure does amaze me. There is power positive thinking. I’ m the dad who listens to gangster rap on the
    way from hot yoga and to the farmers market.

    Almost two months ago,we arrived in Seattle. 2
    I waited a long time for the Uber to arrive. I didn’t have
    a U.S. cell phone number . I had no way to contact the driver. So, I (started to) hitchhike. however, no one

##   10 GOOD SENTENCES
    Is China declining? It’s human nature for leaders to find scapegoats1
    to convince2
    followers that the
    enemy is at the gate and only a patriotic3
    leader can protect and defend them. One would likely expect to see
    Chinese President Xi Jinping play a more prominent4 and visible role as leader if any significant5 problems
    arise. During moments of crises, a good and strong leader will take charge to ensure his citizens can overcome
    challenges and to inspire hope for them. That’s why leaders are leaders. China is not declining and even if
    catastrophes6
    strike that won’t lead to the downfall of the nation.
    The decline of superpowers often occurs as an inevitable7
    result of time and a moral8 decay9 of the citizenry.
    Rich nations had enjoyed wealth and power for far too long and inevitably they lose a strong work ethic10 and
    stop caring about defending national interests. Hence, other global powers rise to their ascendancy11 and
    challenge them for the right to be recognized as a global leader. This does not always imply a war is necessary.
    We can expect China to stay strong at least for the next few decades to come.

## 11 Take Care How You Hear: How to Receive God’s Word
    We fall out of Bible-reading habits a hundred ways, and all of them are deadly serious. Jesus warned us, with
    a story, about the perils1 we face.
    When we hear the parable2 of the sower3
    , are we quick to plant ourselves in the good soil? Do we stop to
    wonder whether we’re the plant without roots, or the one that dries up and withers4
    , or the one choked5 out
    by thorns6
    ? Many of us assume we’re Peter, not the Pharisees7
    , and certainly not Judas. We’re more
    prone8
    to assume safety, security, and blessing for ourselves. For some, the parable of the sower might inspire
    relief and confidence, rather than healthy fear and vigilance9. Thank God I wasn’t like the others.
    But if the parable comforts us without awakening urgency and expectation, we have missed Jesus’s point. He
    ends by saying, when he’s alone with his disciples10
    , “Take care then how you hear” (Luke 8:18). In other
    words, don’t assume you’re in good soil, but look carefully at how you receive the word of God.
    Relentlessly11 plead12 with God to water13 the seed he has given you, to send your roots ever deeper, and to
    protect you from the temptations and distractions around you. Plead with God to keep you.
    With heaven and hell at stake14, joy and misery in the balance, and obstacles before us and within us, we must
    take care how we hear the words of God.
###  11.1 What Are These Words?
    Before we consider the kind of soil we should be, we need to know what kind of seed this is. The seed gets lost,
    as seeds often do, in the shuffle15 of Jesus’s parable. But the seed, not the soil, is the real story here. Nothing
    comes from any soil, no matter how fertile, if a seed is never planted. And this seed is unlike any the earth has
    ever received.
    Jesus begins by saying, “Now the parable is this: The seed is the word of God” (Luke 8:11). The first test of
    the soil in our own hearts is how those seven simple words fall on us. Why would we ever bear fruit if we don’
    t treasure the seed — the very word of the one who spoke the galaxies16 into reality? Hearing God well in the
    spoken gospel and written Bible begins with the awareness that we are hearing — really hearing — God
    himself in his word (1 Thessalonians 2:13).
    “All Scripture17 is breathed out by God” (2 Timothy 3:16–17). Every word came from the infinite wisdom
    and imagination of God. Every sentence, paragraph, and book was conceived18 by the Author of life, the
    Alpha and Omega19, the Lord of heaven and earth. Nothing in the Bible made it into our hands without first

    passing through his.
###  11.2 Humility: Defeating the Greatest Threat
    What kind of soil, then, should we hope to be for such a seed as this? What will be our posture toward God
    when we open his word? Three ingredients, among others, will be humility, submission, and prayer.
    Humility comes first. Pride poisons the soil in our hearts like nothing else. Busyness is not the greatest threat
    to daily Bible reading. Self-confidence is. None of us forgets to eat for days, because everything in us tells us
    we need food. What does it say about our hearts when we skip the food we need the most, sometimes for days
    or weeks at a time? One powerful way to ignite our time alone in God’s word is to confront and kill our
    remaining pride. We pray with king David, “Search me, O God, and know my heart! Try me and know my
    thoughts! And see if there be any grievous way in me, and lead me in the way everlasting!” (Psalm 139:23–24).
    “Busyness is not the greatest threat to daily Bible reading. Self-confidence is.” Tweet Share on Facebook
    The seed of God’s word loves to grow in the rich soil of humility. Our Lord says, “This is the one to whom I
    will look: he who is humble and contrite in spirit and trembles at my word” (Isaiah 66:2). The man whose
    delight is in the law of the Lord knows he does not deserve these words — he doesn’t deserve to have them,
    to understand them, or to delight in them. He knows well that the having, the understanding, the enjoying,
    even the obeying are each their own staggering gift of grace. He prays, “Open my eyes, that I may behold
    wondrous things out of your law” (Psalm 119:18).
### 11.3 Submission: Welcoming God’s Authority
    Humility, then, leads to glad submission to God’s authority. If the Bible truly is the word of a sovereign,
    holy, and just God, how we hear can bear frightening and wonderful consequences. These are not tips for
    living a better, more productive, more successful life. These are not merely suggestions for improving our
    spiritual health. These words are the wondrous promises and unmitigated commands of a God who will and
    must judge sin.
    These words have authority, an increasingly unpopular word today, at least in our society. And God’s
    authoritative words demand from us an even more unpopular posture: submission. We don’t want anyone to
    have full, unqualified authority over us. We want to be able to “commit” with one foot safely outside the
    door, in case someone, even God, asks us to do anything we don’t want to do. The Bible, however, does not
    give us the option to be half in — to enjoy comfort while we sow to sin, to receive forgiveness and forgo
    holiness, to gain joy without suffering and sacrifice.
    To ignore, neglect, minimize, or avoid the word of God is to ignore, neglect, minimize, or avoid God himself
    (Deuteronomy 18:19) — which is an offense greater even than theft, adultery, or murder. Disregarding what
    God has said is, in fact, the sin that ultimately makes every other sin so horribly wicked. To gladly submit to
    the Bible, however, is to gladly submit to God himself.
### 11.4 Prayer: Asking God for Help
    Finally, then, humility and submission lead us, in prayer, to ask for God’s help. The longest chapter in the
    Bible is an extended, even uncomfortably long, prayer about the words of God. Psalm 119 sings,
    I will meditate on your precepts and fix my eyes on your ways. I will delight in your statutes; I will not forget
    your word. (Psalm 119:15–16) If we don’t know what to pray for when we read the Bible, this psalm gives us
    plenty of good places to start. To take care how you hear, consider seven ways you might pray, inspired by
    Psalm 119.
  
#### 11.4.1 1. God, incline and enlarge my heart toward you.
    Incline my heart to your testimonies. (Psalm 119:36)
    I will run in the way of your commandments when you enlarge my heart! (Psalm 119:32)
#### 11.4.2 2. Help me understand what I read.
    Make me understand the way of your precepts, and I will meditate on your wondrous works. (Psalm 119:27)
    Your hands have made and fashioned me; give me understanding that I may learn your commandments.
    (Psalm 119:73; see also Psalm 119:125, 144, 169)
#### 11.4.3 3. Make me diligent to keep your words.
    This blessing has fallen to me, that I have kept your precepts. (Psalm 119:56)
    Blessed are those who keep his testimonies, who seek him with their whole heart. . . . You have commanded
    your precepts to be kept diligently. (Psalm 119:2, 4)
#### 11.4.4 4. Pour your light on the path of my life.
    Your word is a lamp to my feet and a light to my path. (Psalm 119:105)
    The unfolding of your words gives light; it imparts understanding to the simple. (Psalm 119:130)
#### 11.4.5 5. Strengthen me in sorrow.
    My soul melts away for sorrow; strengthen me according to your word! (Psalm 119:28)
#### 11.4.6 6. Shield me from every kind of distraction.
    Turn my eyes from looking at worthless things; and give me life in your ways. (Psalm 119:37)
#### 11.4.7 7. Keep your promises.
    Uphold me according to your promise, that I may live, and let me not be put to shame in my hope! (Psalm
    119:116)
    Your promise is well tried, and your servant loves it. (Psalm 119:140) Come Eagerly to the Word
    Jesus says, “As for that in the good soil, they are those who, hearing the word, hold it fast in an honest and
    good heart, and bear fruit with patience” (Luke 8:15). May God be pleased to increasingly make our souls
    into good soil for his word — in humility, in submission, and in prayer. He loves to give his people the
    faith-filled posture of the Bereans, who “received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily
    to see if these things were so” (Acts 17:11).
    John Piper says, “Every day with meekness receive the word of God. That is, every day be in the Bible.
    Breathe the Bible. Don’t try to hold your breath from Monday to Wednesday. Breathe every day” ( “Receive with Meekness the Implanted Word”). Breathe in the wonder of having the words of God, humble
    yourself and gladly submit before them, and pray for greater insight and delight. Take care how you hear, and
    live in the pages of the Bible.
