## You Raise me up
    When I am down, and, oh, my soul, so weary
    When troubles come, and my heart burdened be
    Then, I am still and wait here in the silence

    You raise me up to more than I can be
## Amzing Grace
    Amazing Grace, How sweet the sound
    That saved a wretch like me
    I once was lost, but now am found
    T'was blind but now I see
    
    T'was Grace that taught my heart to fear
    And Grace, my fears relieved
    How precious did that grace appear
    The hour I first believed
    
    Through many dangers, toils and snares
    We have already come.
    T'was grace that brought us safe thus far
    And grace will lead us home,
    And grace will lead us home
    
    Amazing grace, Howe Sweet the sound
    That saved a wretch like me
    I once was lost but now am found
    T'was blind but now I see
    
    Was blind, but now I see.

## Blessed Assurance Lyrics
    Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine!
    Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine!
    Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
    Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood
    
    Chorus:
    This is my story, this is my song,
    Praising my Savior all the day long;
    This is my story, this is my song,
    Praising my Savior all the day long.
    
    Perfect submission, perfect delight,
    Visions of rapture now burst on my sight;
    Angels, descending, bring from above
    Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.
    
    Perfect submission, all is at rest,
    I in my Savior am happy and blest,
    Watching and waiting, looking above,
    Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.
    
## Come, thou Fount of every blessing
    Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,
      Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
    Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
      Call for songs of loudest praise.
    Teach me some melodious sonnet,
      Sung by flaming tongues above.
    Praise the mount, I’m fixed upon it,
      Mount of Thy redeeming love.
    
    Sorrowing I shall be in spirit,
      Till released from flesh and sin,
    Yet from what I do inherit,
      Here Thy praises I'll begin;
    Here I raise my Ebenezer;
      Here by Thy great help I’ve come;
    And I hope, by Thy good pleasure,
      Safely to arrive at home.
    
    Jesus sought me when a stranger,
      Wandering from the fold of God;
    He, to rescue me from danger,
      Interposed His precious blood;
    How His kindness yet pursues me
      Mortal tongue can never tell,
    Clothed in flesh, till death shall loose me
      I cannot proclaim it well.
    
    O to grace how great a debtor
      Daily I’m constrained to be!
    Let Thy goodness, like a fetter,
      Bind my wandering heart to Thee.
    Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it,
      Prone to leave the God I love;
    Here’s my heart, O take and seal it,
      Seal it for Thy courts above.
    
    O that day when freed from sinning,
      I shall see Thy lovely face;
    Clothèd then in blood washed linen
      How I’ll sing Thy sovereign grace;
    Come, my Lord, no longer tarry,
      Take my ransomed soul away;
    Send thine angels now to carry
      Me to realms of endless day.

## Count Your Blessings
    When upon life's billows you are tempest tossed
    When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost
    Count your many blessings, name them one by one
    And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done
    
    Are you ever burdened with a load of care?
    Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?
    Count your many blessings, every doubt will fly
    And you will keep singing as the days go by
    
    So, amid the conflict, whether great or small
    Do not be disheartened, God is over all
    Count your many blessings, angels will attend
    Help and comfort give you to your journey's end
    
    Count your blessings, name them one by one
    Count your blessings, see what God hath done
    Count your blessings, name them one by one
    And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done
## How Great Thou Art
    O Lord my God, When I in awesome wonder,
    Consider all the worlds Thy Hands have made;
    I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder,
    Thy power throughout the universe displayed.
    
    Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
    How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
    Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
    How great Thou art, How great Thou art!
    
    When through the woods, and forest glades I wander,
    And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees.
    When I look down, from lofty mountain grandeur
    And see the brook, and feel the gentle breeze.
    
    Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
    How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
    Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
    How great Thou art, How great Thou art!
    
    And when I think, that God, His Son not sparing;
    Sent Him to die, I scarce can take it in;
    That on the Cross, my burden gladly bearing,
    He bled and died to take away my sin.
    
    Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
    How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
    Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
    How great Thou art, How great Thou art!
    
    When Christ shall come, with shout of acclamation,
    And take me home, what joy shall fill my heart.
    Then I shall bow, in humble adoration,
    And then proclaim: "My God, how great Thou art!"
    
    Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
    How great Thou art, How great Thou art.
    Then sings my soul, My Saviour God, to Thee,
    How great Thou art, How great Thou art!
## Peace in Christ
    There is peace in Christ
    When we learn of Him
    Feel the love He felt for us
    When He bore our sins
    
    Listen to His words
    Let them come alive
    If we Know Him as He is
    There is peace in Christ
    
    He gives us hope
    When hope is gone
    He gives us strength
    When we can't go on
    He gives us shelter
    In the storms of life
    When there's no peace
    on earth
    There is peace in Christ
    
    There is peace in Christ
    When we walk with Him
    Though the streets of
    Galilee to Jerusalem
    
    Mend the Broken Hearts
    Dry the tear-fillerd eyes
    When we live the way He
    lived
    There is peace in Christ
    
    He gives us hope
    When hope is gone
    He gives us strength
    When we can't go on
    He gives us shelter
    In the storms of life
    When there's no peace
    on earth
    There is peace in Christ
    He gives us hope
    When hope is gone
    He gives us strength
    When we can't go on
    He gives us shelter
    In the storms of life
    When there's no peace
    on earth
    There is peace in Christ
    When there's no peace
    on earth
    There is peace in Christ
## To God be the glory
    To God be the glory, great things he hath done!
    So loved he the world that he gave us his Son,
    who yielded his life an atonement for sin,
    and opened the lifegate that all may go in.
    
    Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
    let the earth hear his voice!
    Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
    let the people rejoice!
    O come to the Father thru Jesus the Son,
    and give him the glory, great things he hath done!
    
    O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,
    to every believer the promise of God;
    the vilest offender who truly believes,
    that moment from Jesus a pardon receives.
    
    Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
    let the earth hear his voice!
    Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
    let the people rejoice!
    O come to the Father thru Jesus the Son,
    and give him the glory, great things he hath done!
    
    Great things he hath taught us, great things he hath done,
    and great our rejoicing thru Jesus the Son;
    but purer, and higher, and greater will be
    our wonder, our transport, when Jesus we see.
    
    Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
    let the earth hear his voice!
    Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
    let the people rejoice!
    O come to the Father thru Jesus the Son,
    and give him the glory, great things he hath done!
    Oh give him the glory, great things he hath done
    Praise the Lord, praise the Lord
    Great things he hath done.
    Praise the Lord, praise the Lord
    He gave us his son.
    Blessed assurance, blessed assurance, blessed assurance
    Jesus is mine.

## What a friend we have in Jesus
    What a friend we have in Jesus
    All our sins and griefs to bear!
    What a privilege to carry
    Everything to God in prayer!
    O what peace we often forfeit
    O what needless pain we bear
    All because we do not carry
    Everything to God in prayer
    
    Have we trials and temptations?
    Is there trouble anywhere?
    We should never be discouraged
    Take it to the Lord in prayer
    Can we find a friend so faithful
    Who will all our sorrows share?
    Jesus knows our every weakness
    Take it to the Lord in prayer
    
    Are we weak and heavy laden
    Cumbered with a load of care?
    Precious Savior, still our refuge
    Take it to the Lord in prayer
    Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
    Take it to the Lord in prayer!
    In his arms he'll take and shield thee
    Thou wilt find a solace there
## Hallelujah
    Now, I've heard there was a secret chord
    That David played, and it pleased the Lord
    But you don't really care for music, do you?
    It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
    The minor fall, the major lift
    The baffled king composing hallelujah
    
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah
    
    Your faith was strong but you needed proof
    You saw her bathing on the roof
    Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew ya
    She tied you to a kitchen chair
    She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
    And from your lips she drew the hallelujah
    
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah
    
    You say I took the name in vain
    I don't even know the name
    But if I did, well really, what's it to you?
    There's a blaze of light in every word
    It doesn't matter which you heard
    The holy or the broken hallelujah
    
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah
    Hallelujah
    
    I did my best, it wasn't much
    I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch
    I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you
    And even though it all went wrong
    I'll stand before the lord of song
    With nothing on my tongue but hallelujah
    
    Hallelujah
